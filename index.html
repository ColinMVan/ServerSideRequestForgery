          SSRF is a type of web application vulnerability that allows attackers
          to manipulate requests sent from the server to other systems.<br /><br />
          In simpler terms, it means an attacker can make the server perform
          actions on their behalf, such as accessing sensitive data or executing
          commands on other systems.

        <div class="info">
          In 2019, Capital One suffered a major data breach due to an SSRF
          vulnerability that allowed the attacker to access over 100 million
          customer records. <br />
          <br />
          In 2018, a vulnerability in Uber's app allowed attackers to use SSRF
          to access sensitive information, including the company's AWS
          credentials. <br />
          <br />
          In 2020, a bug in Microsoft Teams' authentication process allowed
          attackers to use SSRF to steal authentication tokens and access user
          accounts.

          SSRF can have a significant impact on businesses, including loss of
          sensitive data, reputational damage, and financial losses.
          <br /><br />
          Attackers can use SSRF to bypass firewalls, access internal systems,
          and launch further attacks on the network. <br /><br />
          The increasing use of cloud computing and microservices has made SSRF
          more prevalent and harder to detect.

        <div class="info">
          SSRF is a serious web application vulnerability that can have a
          significant impact on businesses and individuals. <br /><br />
          It is important for organizations to implement robust security
          measures, such as input validation and network segmentation, to
          mitigate the risk of SSRF attacks. <br /><br />
          Regular security testing and bug bounties can help identify and
          address SSRF vulnerabilities before they are exploited by attackers.
